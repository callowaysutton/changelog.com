    <h4 id="local-recording">Creating a local audio recording</h4>

    <p><a href="https://riverside.fm">Riverside</a> takes care of recording everyone's local audio. As a backup to that (because Murphy's Law), we ask that you <mark>please create a local audio recording of just your voice</mark>. Here's some videos on how to do that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>On macOS, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/beEbtC7dv08?t=20">using the built-in QuickTime Player</a></li>
      <li>On Windows, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/PKWzwumeY-U">using the built-in Sound Recorder</a> ("Voice Recorder" on Windows 10)</li>
      <li>On Linux, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/0Lde3LThQ_E?t=54">using Audacity</a></li>
